# Finale Scripts

This is a repository of FinaleScripts and JW Lua files that are publicly available.

In order to use the FinaleScripts, just copy the text inside the `txt` files and paste it into a new script in your FinaleScript plugin in Finale.

All files have a header with comments describing the author of the script and the date. It could also have other info, like version of the script, minimal version of Finale, description and what the author finds important to add.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to make pull requests. But, please, add at least the `author` of the script in the beginning of the file, like this:

    /**
     * Author: John Doe <johndoe@email.com>
     */

Upload your FinaleScripts in `txt` format. Although it is possible to add the `xml` files generated by FinaleScript, I think that copying and pasting the code is easier.
